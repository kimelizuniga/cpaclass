                            Intercultural communication (IC) requires knowledge and skills. It also requires <b>understanding</b> and <b>empathy.</b> 
                        </li>
                        <li>

                                Perspective is critical:

                    <h6>Influence of Culture on Nonverbal Communication</h6>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Cultures vary on their specific range and use of behaviours
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <span class="list-heading">Example:</span> In general, Canadians expect a high degree of respect for public and especially for private property and space. Canadians generally have a very strong sense of space (no more or less than an arm’s length); particularly when speaking or dealing with strangers. It is best to carefully observe each person’s degree of comfort with touching and their preference for personal space (i.e. lining up at a bank)
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The rules vary from province to province, eg: in Quebec people may not need as much personal space, and touching is more common. Typically, people from Quebec greet each other using more physical signs such as hugs and kisses and may offer kisses on the cheek to newcomers after a few encounters.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Space is also important to Canadians when driving – i.e. travelling to Greece; India where lanes are not enforced/communicated by law
                        </li>
